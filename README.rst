What's Git?
===========

This project is aimed at understanding Git by building a
semantically-equivalent system.  The intention is to model the
abstractions that Git presents to a user, but it is not meant to
produce anything like a real version-control system.  In particular,
it does not implement many of the optimizations in the Git
implementation.
